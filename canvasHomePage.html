<p>Welcome to CH 501 Semlink+ The Church to the Reformation! This course and its successor, CH502, will be your introduction to what the Lord has done through his Church since the end of the New Testament. In this course you will learn of the spread of the Church through Africa, Europe, and Asia in the first 15 centuries of Christian history. You will gain first-hand exposure to important writings from Christian history. And equally important, you will have the chance to reflect with your fellow students and individually on how you can use insights from Christian history in your own ministry.</p>
<p>Here is our prayer for this semester:</p>
<p>"Father, we thank you for the way you have called us to yourself, making us a part of the great cloud of witnesses that has testified throughout history to the value of knowing your Son. We thank you for the men and women who have gone before us, whom you have filled with your Spirit so that they could testify to your Son before the world. We thank you for the way you have guided your people throughout Christian history. We thank you for the way you have illumined your people to understand your Word, to reflect deeply upon your truth, and to articulate your truth that we too might understand and follow you. We pray that this semester we might attend to your servants in the past, so as to listen to you: that we might hear you speak afresh to us from the past, so that we too may follow you more fully, fervently, and persistently."</p>
